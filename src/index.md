Project by Naoto Hieda & Frog Edogawa

The project started with a joke while I was shopping for clothes in Kyoto with [Marie](https://marieflanagan.com/) in December 2023. The day before traveling to Kyoto, I was supposed to go home to pack my luggage, but instead, I ended up partying with [Iioana](https://www.youtube.com/@IIOANA) in Shinjuku and I stayed at a capsule hotel in Tokyo. I directly went to Kyoto so I didn't have clothes to change. Therefore, when I arrived in Kyoto and joined Marie, who was already visiting there, we decided to go for shopping. We went to a few second-hand stores but couldn't find anything appealing. I could find nice sweaters but they are not the priority (since I was traveling, I rather needed T-shirts and trousers) and I said,

<blockquote class="ml-4">
  If I were to wear only a piece of clothes, it would be a sweater.

Coming back from the trip to Kyoto, I tried photoshooting at Ottonuma Park, a park in my neighborhood as a test with my phone, being half naked. I sent the photo to Kaeru (Frog Edogawa), a photographer friend. We know each other since we met at a contact improvisation workshop in Tokyo around 2017; since then, we hang out when I am visiting Japan. She offered me to do a proper photoshoot.

The photoshoot took place at Arakawa river in Tokyo, which is at a walking distance from the studio where we met.

*If you want to exhibit the photos, please contact me (mail at naotohieda dot com) with your info. If we vibe, I can send you more samples as well as the NSFW version. Thanks!*

I acquired the sweater on May 20, 2023 on a street in Wuppertal, Germany for free.

This was a period when I lived in Germany with my brother. It was supposed to last for a year, but prematurely he decided to fly back to Japan, and later I decided to move out and to pursue a new career path in Estonia.

In the kitchen, I had a small argument with my brother. Although I don't party often, that day I felt I needed to go out to party and to dance. But the problem was that I didn't have friends yet in town and didn't know where the good party is. I decided to go see an open-air contemporary performance. After the show, I joined a group of Chileans and some of them mentioned that there is a outdoor rave in town. I followed them (by the way, on the way to the rave, I made a few more friends on the street, who turned out to become good friends. Nevertheless, I lost contact with the Chileans) and when we are arriving at the rave venue, I saw a couple throwing some clothes in a clothing donation box. I stopped them and picked up a sweater. It fit perfectly and when I asked them if I can keep it, they said of course (I vaguely remember that I had the conversation in my bad German).

The party was ok. The population was a bit young, and I don't recall anything about the music except that at one point they were using Doja Cat samples, which was catchy and was my favorite part.

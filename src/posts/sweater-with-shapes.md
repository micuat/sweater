It was bought on December 2nd, 2023 at a second hand store in Aeon Mall Tsukuba for 10 bucks. In Japan, Amekaji, which stands for American casual, is a popular genre of clothes including ones imported from the United States as well as ones imitate the "American" style and produced in Japan. Personally, Amekaji is not my taste especially the Japanese imitation, but I do window shopping at Amekaji vintage stores because sometimes I find a rare find like this sweater.

This is one of the newest in my sweater collection and I don't have many stories to share. Indeed, it has everything I like: blue color, borders and shapes. It is uplifting and I often wear it when I meet new people or go to new places.
